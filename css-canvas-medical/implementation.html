          <p class="list">
            You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined that
            we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return on invesment. Our
            goal is to give you as much information as possible to make this determination one
            way or the other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application for
            you to get a feel for the platform as well as reference to current customers to talk
            about their experience.
          </p>
          <h1>2. <span class="clinic-mini-head">Interfaces and Community Integration</span></h1>
          <p class="list">
            Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and community
            resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax number, enrolling your
            payers with our clearing house, and getting bidrectional lab feeds runnings. We'll
            also load your preferred specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that
            sending referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health
            information exchanges or other information technolgoy vendors are important, we
            will work with you to determine what we can deliver and when.
          </p>
          <h1>3. <span class="clinic-mini-head">Data Migration</span></h1>
          <p class="list">
            The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your current data, which
            we have executed and successfully with both remotely hosted and on-premise EMR
            databases. Then our work begins to import into Canvas. Patient demographics and
            information like medications, problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward.
            While importing clinical notes and documents is more challenging, our team has
            been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.
          </p>
          <h1>4. <span class="clinic-mini-head">Training and Site Visit</span></h1>
          <p class="list">
            We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content,
            charge schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings will be done a few weeks
            prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team members with clinical, practice
            management, and billing workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our
            team can visit your practice to work side-by-side with you on implementation and
            training.
          </p>
          <h1>5. <span class="clinic-mini-head">Go-Live and Tuning</span></h1>
          <p class="list">
            Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice. We will be
            with you, either in-person or remotely depending on your preference, to make sure
            everything goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you have a
            handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing clinical microtemplates,
            setting up new automations, modifying practice management settings, and more.
            We are here to help with it all.
          </p>
          <h1>6. <span class="clinic-mini-head">Sustained Performance</span></h1>
          <p class="list">
            All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises and provide
            support over the long term. Our Performance Warranty means that if we are not
            meeting expectations, you can terminate the agreement and receive all payments
            backs. (We do not expect this to happen). For our Standard plans, we also offer a
            MIPS guarantee: if you receive a negative adjustment, we will cover it. And for
            everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect this to be a
            long, productive partnerhsip for us both.
